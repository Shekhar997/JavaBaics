1. Different ways to create an object in java?

2. How do you keep the count of active number of object in class?

3. For final variable we need to create the parametrised constructor to initialize. And once initialize the variable we can't change variable value
   We have to delete the object and recreate 
   
4. Whenever we are creating a class we have to judge should it be a child class or should it be a variable inside a class
   -> Is a and has a relationship
   --> Anything which is a class is inheritance 
   --> Anything which has a relation is a attribute
   
   For example 
   		-> Employee has a address (It will be attribute of class) -> Bcoz if we create a class it will get the properties of parent class.
   																	 Address class will have the id,name. But address should not need id, name
   																	 
   		-> FullTimeEmployee is a employee so it will extend Employee
    
 
5. Why multiple inheritance is not supported?
	If fullTimeEmployee extends Employee, Person
	
	and we call display method then JVM will get confused that which display is being called? Either of Employee or of person?
	It will add ambiguity to the code
	
	Solution is Interface

	
6. Is JVM platform independent? 
   -> Ans - No JVM is not platform independent
   
7. Difference between super() and super.
	-> super() - its use to call the constructor of the parent class
	-> super. -> its use to point to the object of parent class
	
8. Difference between this() and this.
	- this() - its use to call the constructor of the current class
	- this. -> its use to point to the object of current class
